	<h1><center>Evaluation of Maricopa County Library District Website</center></h1>
	<h2><center>LIS 636 | Assignment Three | Ashley Conte</center></h2>
	<hr />
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The Maricopa County Library District is a public library system located in central Arizona that is comparable to the Charlotte Mecklenburg public library system located in North Carolina in terms of size and services. With 18 library branches and multiple partnerships with cities, towns, and school districts Maricopa County Library District is one of the largest public library systems on the west coast. It also has a vast amount of online resources and eMedia content such as OverDrive, Hoopla, Kanopy, and Gale courses. This essay will assess the quality of the website for the Maricopa County Library District using Jesse James Garrett’s five elements, or planes, of the user experience: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface. Before diving in, let’s take a look at the home page (Figure 1) which can be found at <a href="https://www.mcldaz.org/">https://www.mcldaz.org/</a>.</p>

	<h3>The Strategy Plane</h3>
	<p>The mission statement for the Maricopa County Library District is as follows “to provide access and services so residents experience an improved quality of life” (Mission, 2019) and the values the library district adheres to are “discovery, engagement, access, community, and innovation” (Values, 2019). Based off of these doctrines it seems that the library’s main objective is to give residents access to the library’s resources and services. The word <em>access</em> was mentioned twice. Hopefully, this access will lead to discovery, engagement, sense of community, and innovation among residents. It would make sense that the library creates a website that provides such access in order to facilitate such growth. The <strong>product objectives</strong> would be to improve residents’ quality of life with access to library resources and services which will then generate loyal and lifelong patrons. The <strong>user needs</strong> would be to use the library’s resources and services to improve their lives in some way. Does the website convey such objectives and needs? It’s hard to tell at a first glance and requires further insight from the other four planes.</p>
	<h3>The Scope Plane</h3>
	<p>What does the website need to provide the kind of access mentioned in both the mission statement and the library values? The <strong>functional specifications</strong> seem to be things such as a search bar for material access, a calendar for event access, links to digital resources for online access, and the ability to modify the website for wider access such as language options for those who don’t speak English, text size options for those with visual impairments, and mobile friendly design for those who mostly use cellphones. The <strong>content requirements</strong> should definitely include a discovery layer (such as EBSCO Discovery Service) to act as a content management system. Taking a look at different types of possible users the following other content requirements should be considered:
		<ul>
			<li>New Parent User: storytime event listings</li>
			<li>High School or College Student User: homework help resources</li>
			<li>Avid Reader of Any Age User: book listings (ie. Staff Picks)</li>
			<li>Small Business Owner User: business database resources</li>
			<li>Job Hunter User: resume building and resume help resources</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>The Structure Plane</h3>
	<p>There’s a lot to consider when attempting to review the structure plane of a website: do the buttons work? Are they defined? Do the labels make sense? The better these features work, the better the access to resources become for users. Aside from these important questions two concepts were kept in mind: interaction design and information architecture. <strong>Interaction design</strong> refers to how well a user can perform tasks on the website and after completing a few tasks on the Maricopa County Library District website it seems that interaction design is fairly strong. The navigation bars on the top and left of the screen provide users with a clear way to move around the site through noticeable drop-down buttons and labels that are categorized well. The visuals of the navigation, which include down-pointing arrows and plus and minus bars (Figure 2), are a huge help to users as they make it easy for them to discover where to go next.</p>

		<center><strong>Figure 2. Navigation Visuals Displayed and Highlighted in Yellow</strong></center>
	<p>The only issue that seemed to hurt the website’s interaction design was its poor error handling. Error handling was weak because of two things: a lack of breadcrumbs to help users keep track of their location and a lack of continuity with links in regards to whether they brought you to another place on the site itself or to another website altogether. The combination of a lack of breadcrumbs for users to follow and the fact that users may be led to an entirely different site (ex. the New York Times Best-Sellers page) makes it hard for users to get back to where they started which ultimately leads to poor access.</p>
	<p><strong>Information architecture</strong> refers to how well information is conveyed and the Maricopa County District Library website does a great job with this concept. The website seems to utilize a bottom-up approach with many lower level categories, like navigation tabs, leading up to the overall strategy of user access which leads to navigation tabs that are well placed and well thought out for maximum access. While the actual navigation of such tabs may be a little tricky due to the issues raised with error handling, there is no disputing that the labels themselves convey basic concepts like events, help, and search. The labels are clear for the most part with only one area that could be better handled: online resources. All the online resources should be categorized together under one label as opposed to splitting them into an “eMedia” label and a “Learn” label.</p>
	<h3>The Skeleton Plane</h3>
	<p>The main questioned asked while considering the skeleton plane was whether the layout and placement of the “boxes” makes sense for users. The more "sense" it makes, the better access users have. By assessing the interface design, the navigation design, and the information design an answer to this question can be reached. The <strong>interface design</strong> refers to whether a user’s eye is immediately drawn to the important parts of the site. Maricopa County Library District’s website accomplishes this with two main features:
		<ol>
			<li>The rotating slideshow highlighting important content like finding a nearest library branch, renewing a library card online, and eMedia services like OverDrive and Hoopla.</li>
			<li>The four boxes right under the slide show labeled Events, Renew Your Card, No Fines, and Homework Help.</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Thinking back to the potential users mentioned in the scope plane, these features cover a lot of such users’ content requirements. To have such important content requirements highlighted with pictures and easy-to-spot buttons is great interface design. The only drawback would be the search bar’s small size and lack of color. The search bar should be much larger and much more noticeable and should preferable be a persistent navigation.</p>
	<p>The <strong>navigation design</strong> refers to whether a user can get from one place to another easily and whether the navigation relationships are clear. Maricopa County Library District website’s navigation tabs, with sub-navigation links, make complete sense and the relationships are clear. However, getting from one place to another is more difficult as some links stay within the site (Ex. the <em>New Title</em> link stays on the site itself) while others take users out of the site (Ex. the <em>New Additions</em> link takes users to Wowbrary’s website). Figure 3 shows the pages that appear for both the <em>New Title</em> link and the <em>New Additions</em> link.</p>

	<p>The <strong>information design</strong> refers to whether the main ideas are communicated well. The answer to this question seems to be yes as the links and buttons are all grouped and labeled well. For example, it was not difficult to locate the mission statement under the <em>About Us</em> tab when working on the strategy plane paragraph. Overall, the layout and placement of the site’s boxes makes sense with only minor issues with link navigations.</p>
	<h3>The Surface Plane</h3>
	<p>The surface plane is arguably the most fun plane to evaluate because it involves considering the color scheme of the website as well as all other aesthetic features.  These aesthetic features are referred to as the <strong>sensory design</strong>. Maricopa County Library District wants to draw users in with such design so they become more likely to access all the resources and services available to them. The tan and blue coloring, while soothing, is not very eye catching. The hints of maroon and pea green displayed in the four boxes under the slide show are more eye catching leading one to believe that perhaps such colors could be selectively used in other important places. For example, such use of color may be helpful to use on the search bar. Unfortunately, these four boxes are the only color variety used on the website and even these repeat the blue color twice. The lack of color, combined with the very boxy and rectangular navigation, make the website appear slightly old fashioned. The slideshow and the Most Popular area with pictures of movie and book covers (Figure 4) are the most visual aspects of the website as they make a user interested in clicking to learn more. By including more color and varying the shapes of each area the site could gain a more modern feel.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Overall, the Maricopa County Library District website does accomplish the institution’s goal of providing access to users in order to improve users’ quality of life. Exploring the site for this evaluation proves that a single user can find specific things he or she may be looking for such as reading lists, events, homework help, or account settings. By tweaking a few things in some of the planes this library district may be able to provide an even better online experience for its users. Below is a quick summary of the suggestions mentioned in the structure, skeleton, and surface plane:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Structure Plane: Better error handling with a breadcrumb feature.</li>
			<li>Skeleton Plane: Increasing the visibility of the search bar as well as controlling the navigation of tabs better by keeping links within the site.</li>
			<li>Surface Plane: More color as well as better use of bold colors to draw the eye to important features.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>With such alterations this website could better suite the library’s mission to “to provide access and services so residents experience an improved quality of life” (Mission, 2019).</p>
