	<h3>Overview of the New York Public Library Website</h3>
		<p>When first viewing the New York Public Library (NYPL) website (<a href="https://www.nypl.org/">https://www.nypl.org/</a>), users may think of words such as modern, sleek, formatted, and colorful. The website is all of those things and more because in addition to the aesthetic appeal, it also conveys a tremendous amount of information about this robust and acclaimed institution. Aside from the usual top of the screen and bottom of the screen navigation bars, there seems to be seven major sections of the website’s homepage. First, an ever-changing image banner that highlights different resources and services that the library provides. Currently the banner is promoting a mobile app called SimplyE which provides patrons with over 300,000 e-books. Second, a What’s Happening section that looks much like a news blog or online magazine. This section displays all the exhibitions, author talks, performing arts, film events, and more that take place in this institution every day. Third, a Learn Something New section that publicizes all the educational programs that the library has to offer with heartwarming pictures of children and adults exploring and learning together. Fourth, a Staff Picks section where actual NYPL librarians give quotes recommending books they’ve read and enjoyed. The quote sits above the librarian’s name and along side a picture of the recommended book’s cover. Fifth, a New and Noteworthy section that is very much like a Netflix scrolling column, but instead of advertising the next show for users to watch it advertises the next great book for users to read. Sixth, a From Our Blog section that displays the two most recent NYPL blog posts. Currently they seem to be seasonal for Halloween with “Which Books Should Our Favorite Movie Witches Read?” and “Where to Start with Stephen King?” The seventh, and final section, is the Updates section which helps patrons sign up for email updates and how to plan out their visit to the library. It should be noted that under each of the sections described there is a "…See More" button under each so that users can explore a specific topic further. Below is a screen shot of the homepage.</p>

		<p>For the purpose of this evaluation, the rest of the analysis will focus on the fourth section of the homepage which is the Staff Picks section. This section was chosen for analysis because it is the first extremely eye-catching portion of the homepage. This section is the first section to be behind a bright red background, as opposed to the regular white background, which likely makes it the first portion of the homepage to encourage users to slow down their scrolling to view the banner longer. Aside from the use of color the banner also gets very creative with how the recommendations are displayed using a “talking bubble” to house the librarian’s quote and showing the actual librarian’s name which makes the recommendation seem much more personal. The large pictures of each book cover next to the quotes also catches the eye and adds another level to the overall visual effect. It should be noted that only two recommendations are provided on the homepage banner. Taking all of these factors into consideration it is very easy to see users clicking the "…See More" button under this section of the homepage. When users do click that button, they are brought to the main Staff Picks page. This page seems to have three major sections. At the top of the page is the header which displays the title and provides a one sentence description of the purpose of this page. On the left side of the screen is over 20 filter options which seems to be there with the purpose of helping users narrow their search. Finally, the center of the page is filled with a long display of book covers, next to their titles and a short description, with additional buttons to request either the book or the e-book. Given the plethora of visuals to describe for this section of the NYPL website, it is fitting that the user experience (UX) law that will be used to analyze such a feature is the Aesthetic Usability Effect. The next section will provide a literature review of this UX law.</p> 
	<h3>Literature Review of the Aesthetic Usability Effect</h3>
	  <h4><em>Description and History</em></h4>
		<p>The Aesthetic Usability Effect is generally summed up to mean the following: “users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable” (Yablonski, 2019). Of course, there are other descriptions, in addition to the simple one just stated, that go into further detail into what “more usable” truly means. One such description states “aesthetically pleasing design can make users more tolerant of minor usability issues” (Yablonski, 2019) which hints at the idea that “more usable” means more tolerant of usability issues. Another description claims that “aesthetically pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing” (Yablonski, 2019) which goes a step further to claim that “more usable” means, not only a tolerance of usability issues, but a complete masking of such problems.</p>
		<p>Influencing users to be more tolerant, or completely miss, usability flaws in a website is an extremely powerful tool in the field of visual design, but how did we come to learn about such an effect and where does it stem from? Pedro Canhenha claims that “this law is a combination of the design principle of Aesthetics and the Law of UX which ultimately gives you The Aesthetic Usability Effect” (2018). This effect may get its roots from aesthetic design principles and UX laws, but it was first officially mentioned in a report in 1995. “The aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of human–computer interaction in 1995” (Yablonski, 2019) by two researchers from the Hitachi Design Center. After testing designs for an ATM interface screen, researchers “Kurosu and Kashimura concluded that users are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of any given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality of the system” (Yablonski, 2019). These researchers started this study because they viewed efforts to make an interface easier to understand as fruitless if the interface was not appealing enough to attract attention in the first place. This groundbreaking report, titled <em>Apparent Usability vs. Inherent Usability</em>, provided the powerful insight that “the apparent usability is strongly affected by the aesthetic aspects rather than the inherent usability” (Kurosu, M., & Kashimura, 1995, pg. 292) and thus was the beginning of the Aesthetic Usability Effect designers know and use today.</p>
	  <h4><em>Cultural Influences</em></h4>
		<p>In order to truly understand this UX law one must break down its basic definition: “users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable” (Yablonski, 2019). The last section described in further detail what “more usable” meant. This section seeks to describe in further detail what “aesthetically pleasing” means. It is important to keep in mind that “what users perceive as beautiful and usable strongly depends on their cultural background” (Wikipedia, 2019). “It is unreasonable to design a single common website for everyone and to expect it to attract the international audiences with the same aesthetic interface” (Wikipedia, 2019). Given the importance of culture on perceptions of aesthetics, how can one define a person’s cultural background? Literature claims that “there are several different factors of defining the user's cultural background, such as the user's first language, religion, the education level and the form of education and the social or political norm of the culture” (Wikipedia, 2019). These factors are all important when it comes to influencing audiences with the Aesthetic Usability Effect. But a person’s first language or religion is not the end-all-be-all for whether he or she believes something to be beautiful or not. “Aesthetics, much like any aspect of the Design Practice, is something that can be taught, and that can be exercised” (Canhenha, 2018). The “aesthetically pleasing” portion of the Aesthetic Usability Effect definition seems to be just as fluid and interpretational as the “more usable” portion. Even so, it is vital to continue to attempt to understand all aspects of this definition to further understand this UX law now and in the future.</p>
	  <h4><em>User Biases</em></h4>
		<p>Literature concerning the Aesthetic Usability Effect often mentions a user’s biases when it comes to his or her interpretation of a website design. If a person’s culture manipulates his or her interpretation of whether a design is aesthetically pleasing, then that person’s biases about aesthetics manipulates his or her willingness to use the website at all. It is for this reason that Kurosu and Kashimura began studying this effect since “usability is meaningless for the user if the product is not appealing enough for them to buy” (1995, pg. 292). To break this concept down further, it seems that “aesthetic designs, in general, look easier to use and have a higher probability of being used, whether or not they actually are easier to use” (Chakraborty, 2017). Chakraborty further states that “more usable but less-aesthetic designs may suffer a lack of acceptance that renders issues of usability debates” and it is “these perceptions [that] bias users’ subsequent interactions with the product and are usually resistant to change” (2017). If a user finds a design to be unappealing, they become negatively bias toward such a design and view it as difficult to use even if it is not. Likewise, if a user finds a design to be appealing, they become positively biased toward such a design and view it as easy to use even if it is not. Once these biases are created, they are extremely hard to break.</p>
	  <h4><em>User Attitudes</em></h4>
		<p>Closely related to user biases are user attitudes and such attitudes also have a strong influence on whether a website’s aesthetics affect perceived usability. “Aesthetics designs are more effective at fostering positive attitudes than unaesthetic designs, and make people more tolerant of design problems” (Chakraborty, 2017). This quote shows how vital a positive attitude is when it comes to perceived usability. “Studies show that early impressions of a product influences long-term attitudes about their quality and use” (Chakraborty, 2017) so generating a positive attitude from a user through pleasant design is key to creating loyal website users. User attitude is not only crucial for the Aesthetic Usability Effect, but for user experience in general. Juergen Sauer and Andreas Sonderegger state that “the term ‘user experience’ has been coined to refer to a holistic view of the many facets of user-product interaction, with a particular emphasis on positive emotional outcomes such as joy and fun” (2011, pg. 788).</p>
	  <h4><em>Comparison to Human Attractiveness</em></h4>
		<p>The Aesthetic Usability Effect in the field of visual design is often compared to the Halo Effect in the field of psychology.  Indeed, the two concepts are extremely similar as they both concern the aesthetics, or the beauty, of a design or person and how that can influence someone’s behavior toward such a design or person. In order to provide more detail about the Halo Effect, Chakraborty states “a similar phenomenon is well documented with regard to human attractiveness — first impressions of people influence attitude formation and measurably affect how people are perceived and treated” (2018). People tend to believe that attractive people have better personal qualities than unattractive people, just as they tend to believe that aesthetically appealing designs are easier to use than aesthetically unappealing designs. Whether or not such people truly do possess better qualities or whether or not such designs are easier to use does not seem to matter when such phenomenon are discussed. As Juergen Sauer and Andreas Sonderegger state in their report concerning the Aesthetic Usability Effect “physically more appealing humans were also considered to be more competent and occupationally more successful” (2011, pg. 788). It seems that this law of UX has strong roots in psychological principles, as well as, design principles.</p>
	  <h4><em>A Brief Discussion of Limits</em></h4>
		<p>Everything stated up until this point has described just how powerful the Aesthetic Usability Effect is when it comes to visual design, however; this UX law is not without its limits and such limits deserve to be mentioned in such a literature review. The main limit found in the literature was the following: “a pretty design can make users more forgiving of minor usability problems, but not of larger ones” (Chakraborty, 2017). This connects back to the interpretations of the definition’s use of the phrase “more usable” from earlier discussions. This limit proves that “more usable” only extends to minor usability problems and when a usability problem becomes too disruptive, no amount of aesthetics can make up for it. It seems that usability should never be sacrificed for aesthetics.</p>
	<h3>Analysis of the Staff Picks Feature</h3>
		<p>It could be said that the entire NYPL website is very aesthetically pleasing, however, the Staff Picks section was specifically chosen due its eye-catching components. Such components, summarized in the first paragraph of this evaluation, are very aesthetically pleasing which may lead users to believe it is more usable. The aesthetics may not only lead to better perceived usability, but also to higher perceived trustworthiness and acceptance of such literary picks. The inclusion of librarian names and placing their quotes in talking bubbles gives the recommendation a more personal feel which could further influence a user to check out a certain book. Users may think that if the recommendation is coming straight from a librarian it must be great right? Such use of design to inspire acceptance could also lead to higher usability ratings since user acceptance is a key component to website use. Moving back into pure design; this website feature utilizes aesthetics very well through its use of color, neat lines, and images.</p>
		<p>Below are screenshots of the Staff Picks homepage banner and the Staff Picks header on its main website page. It is clear that the color red is being put to good use in both sections. The bright color immediately draws the eye, especially when it is contrasted with the white background of the rest of the website. The red also makes the talking bubbles stand out more prominently. Such use of color and design can guide a user’s eye movement to the Staff Picks section and then encourage them to read the quotes.</p>

		<p>The color blue is also used to maximum benefit, both in terms of aesthetics and usability, as shown in the screenshot below of the lower portion of the Staff Picks main page. The buttons to request a book are blue and the filter buttons highlight blue when a curser hovers over them (a curser was hovering over the “Biographies & memoirs” button at the time the screenshot was taken). While red draws attention, blue seems to signal action such as searching or requesting books. Such use of color not only adds to the visual effect but also increases usability.</p>

		<p>Neat lines are also used well in order to increase the aesthetics of the website feature both on the homepage and on the feature’s main page. The sharp lines separating the Staff Picks banner on the homepage from the other six sections gives it a neat and orderly feel that is pleasing to the eye. As shown in the screenshot below, neat lines are also present on the top of the Staff Picks main page leading again to a neat and orderly feel. The line under the search bar in the top right, the lines separating the white background from the red background in the header, and the lines under the title of the secondary header are all clean-cut, precise, and aesthetically pleasing.<p>

		<p>Lastly, this feature’s use of images also increases the aesthetic appeal which in turn may lead to higher perceived usability. The inclusion of each recommended book’s cover not only adds more color to the page, but also could be an additional influence for a user to check out a certain book. Let’s face it, most people judge a book by its cover so including these images is definitely helpful. Including the library’s lion logo next to the “talking” librarian’s name is also a good use of image since it gives the impression that the lion is directly talking to the user (please refer to figure 2 for this visual). It also reminds the user of the institution that the librarian works for lending more credence to the recommendation itself. All in all, the Aesthetic Usability Effect is certainly being utilized in the NYPL’s Staff Picks feature due to its great use of color, neat lines, and images.</p>
	<h3>Conclusion and Recommendations</h3>
		<p>As described in the previous section, through the use of colors, neat lines, and images it seems that the Staff Picks feature of the NYPL website practices the UX law called the Aesthetic Usability Effect. The author of this analysis found this feature of the website to be very easy to use and even enjoyed looking through the recommended titles. This could be seen as further proof that the visual appeal of the feature may have influenced the author’s interpretation of its usability. The author also fully understands that her western cultural background, education level, and positive attitude toward anything “book-related” may have also contributed to her being influenced by the Aesthetic Usability Effect for this website feature. Also, there were no major usability issues that could have broken the spell of the Aesthetic Usability Effect proving that the NYPL did not sacrifice usability for aesthetics. Overall, the Staff Picks feature does seem to be extremely neat with just the right amount of color lending credence to the belief that it is easy to use and navigate. One possible recommendation would be to remove the “recommendations” button in the top left corner of the main page header (seen in figure 6). This is recommended for two reasons; first, users are already on the recommendations page so this button adds a level of unnecessary confusion. What else is there to be recommended? Second, it doesn’t follow the same pattern as other buttons since it is not blue, therefore, it does not look like a button at all. Users cannot tell this is a button until they hover over the word and see that the curser changes from an arrow to a pointing hand. It is the author’s recommendation that this button be removed since it does not add anything to the feature’s aesthetics or usability. At the very least it could be changed to blue so it looks like the other website buttons.</p>
