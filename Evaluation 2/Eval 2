	<h1><center>Evaluation of Charlotte Mecklenburg Library Website</center></h1>
	<h2><center>LIS 636 | Assignment Two | Ashley Conte</center></h2>
	<hr />
	<h3>Website Components</h3>
	<p>This website evaluation will describe the components and user tasks of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library website (<a href="https://www.cmlibrary.org">https://www.cmlibrary.org</a>) and decipher whether the components aide or hinder the tasks. After viewing the home page there seem to be seven main components to this public library’s website and they include:
		<ol> 
			<li>Primary navigation including the library logo, site/catalog search bar, account login button, and menu button</li>
			<li>Main banner displaying a monthly initiative or “hot topic”</li>
			<li>Second banner displaying special events and programs</li>
			<li>Nine colorful boxes categorizing all library services from calendar to eBooks</li>
			<li>List of the branches</li>
			<li>Donate/Volunteer section with buttons to each respective action</li>
			<li>Bottom navigation including the logo and search bar again as well as links to the social media accounts</li>
		</ol>
	<p>These components seem to facilitate navigating the whole site, highlighting timely or special material, categorizing all library services for quick access, providing branch location information, inspiring users to give back through donations or volunteering, and giving contact information along with the generic “about us” information. Are these user tasks, facilitated by the seven components, the appropriate user tasks of actual library website useers though? The next section of this evaluation will address this question in fuller detail.</p>
	<h3>User Tasks</h3>
	<p>As a user of this website on a regular basis, I can state from experience that the tasks usually completed when visiting this site are as follows:
		<ol>
			<li>Looking up library books to see the books location or to place a hold</li>
			<li>Looking up library events to see if one sounds education or fun</li>
			<li>Looking up library services to see if a provided service can help me with a task</li>
			<li>Managing my library account including paying fines and seeing if a book is ready for pick up</li>
			<li>Learn basic information about the library and the branches such as which branch is close for renovations or which branch is open on a Sunday</li>
		</ol>
	<p>By comparing the <i>seven components</i> of Charlotte Mecklenburg Library’s website to the <i>five user tasks</i> completed on this website by regular users an analysis can be made of whether such components aide or hinder the completion of the tasks.</p>
	<h3>Analysis of Tasks 1 and 2</h3>
	<p>Task one, looking up books in the system, is very well covered by the search bar always located at the top of the page no matter what page of the website a user is on. By making this navigation bar persistent users can always turn to it to help them look up a book. Once the book is searched for it is made very clear through the use of colored button and labeled links how to locate the book and how to place the book on hold for pick up.  The only downside is that a user must click from the “site” section of the search bar to the “catalog” section in order to get the desired results. Task two, looking up library events, is also well covered by the many links and pictures that will lead a user to such information. The large banner labeled “Special Events and Programs” is an obvious way to find this information, but a user can also search this by clicking on the box labeled “calendar” in box section of the home page for a full list of events and programs. The linked boxes on the homepage are pictured below for reference as Figure 1. There is even a box labeled “storytime” if this is the specific event a user is looking for.</p>

	<h3>Analysis of Tasks 3, 4, and 5</h3>
	<p>Task three, looking up library services, is also made easy for users to do through the number of links and images for such information provided on the home page. A user can click on the first main banner which currently describes how to get a library card in recognition of September being library card sign up month. A user could also click a number of boxes in the box section of the home page to obtain information on library services including the “resource,” “services,” and “job help” boxes to explore these options. Task four, managing a library account, is covered slightly less than the first three tasks since the space allotted to such a task on the home page is much smaller than the previous tasks were given. The one button on the in the primary navigation section is the only way a user to login to his or her account. This button is persistent though, so a user to get to his or her account from any section of the website. By including another link to this login screen or by making the button more noticeable, users may be able to complete this task with more ease. Task five, learning basic information about the library, is also not as well covered by the website components. While there are places a user can go to get such information such as the “branches” box or the branches section of the home page, it is clear that the best home page real estate is saved for events and resources. Users may find this information with more ease if the branches section was moved up on the home page or if the “contact” information for the branches was moved from the bottom navigation to the primary navigation.</p>
