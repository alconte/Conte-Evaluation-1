<h1>Evaluation Writing Assignment One</h1>

<p>The UNCG Library website (<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.library.uncg.edu</a>) has many components that all seem to be designed to aid students with utilizing their library both on campus and online. Since this specific page is just a part of the larger UNCG website it does have some components that act as persistent navigation. These include the site identification in the top left corner, the site search bar in the top right corner, and the primary navigation below this search bar. There are six components that seem to be unique to the library page and such unqiue components speak directly to students, both on campus and online, in order to assist with their educational needs. These six components include: <ol> <li>University Libraries page name above a red search bar</li> <li>Red help box next to this search bar</li> <li>Secondary navigation below the search bar</li> <li>Reservation options for rooms and technology at Jackson Library next to a friendly picture</li> <li>Featured promos called spotlights, timely content labeled “News and Events,” and social media</li> <li>Smaller navigation links at the very bottom </li> </ol></p>
<p>After reviewing the components of the website and deciding upon the intended audience it seems that there are certain tasks this website intends to facilitate for such an audience. Keeping the components and intended audience in mind there seem to be five major tasks the website allows users to do:  <ol> <li>Online research </li> <li>Digital assistance with online research</li> <li>Reservation of services and spaces at Jackson Library for on campus students </li> <li>Handling of a library account such as renewing books or placing books on hold </li> <li>Looking up basic library information such as hours, address, and driving directions</li> </ol>Again, all these tasks seem to be intended for students who need to utilize the Jackson Library in order to complete research for an assignment. There are some available tasks that seem to be more directed at alumni or University stakeholders, aka those who are not completing schoolwork, and these include reading library news, reading the library blog, and following the library on social media. Or perhaps these tasks are included here for when students need a welcome break from their research.</p>
<p>By taking each task and connecting it to a website component an analysis can be made regarding whether the website does a good job of facilitating these tasks for its intended audience. Tasks one, two, and three are all well addressed by the website’s components. Task one, online research, is very well addressed by the large red search bar right under the page name. The color contrast as well as the additional search tabs and links make it clear that users can find any articles and/or books they may need. Task two, assistance with online research, is also well addressed by the red help box that sits right next to the red search bar. The close proximity to where students will first be “searching” reminds them that if they get stuck help is available. Task three, reservations for rooms and technology, is made feasible by the “Available in Jackson Library” component that is right under the search bar. The straightforward links telling students what technology is available, how much is available, and where to go to reserve a room with a yellow button makes this task easy to accomplish.</p>
<p>Tasks four and five do not seem to be as well addressed by the website’s components. Task four, handling a library account, is not well addressed or displayed in a website component since these helpful links have been delegated to the bottom navigation. Most students want to keep track of their library account to avoid fines so having links, like “online book renewals,” at the bottom of the page does not draw a user’s immediate attention and can be easily overlooked. Task five, looking up basic library information, is equal parts well address by components and not well addressed by components. The library hours are given a well viewed spot right next to the secondary navigation, however, things like address and driving directions are delegated to the bottom of the page with the library account information. Overall, this website does a great job of speaking to its audience of students, however, it might better serve these students by swapping the space used for blogs, social media, and news for more library information and library account maintenance.</p>
